LUAS Forecast

I’ve tried to use the MVVM design  pattern on this project, used the JitPack from google for Live Data.
He not used this dashing pattern before. So it was a challenge to me. In the past I used the MVP design
pattern in most of the projects I’ve worked in. Implementing this project I’ve realised that I have to
learn a lot more about reactive programming. What I’ve tried on this project is to implement the Live
Data pattern. I wanted to have a local backup of the Luas statuss , in the case where the user opens the
app and do not have internet connection . This app still has work to be done. There are some unsolved bugs
 and some exceptions that need to be handled. I wanna say that I did not had enough time to give on this small
 project. Started working on it yesterday and finished today. Hope you can all understand  the situation.
I’ve had some problems while working on this project:
	1) the Api provided reruns an xml response , and I only worked in the past with json responses, in the end ,
	I ended up on converting the response to string, then using an xml to json converter , converted that xml string
	to json and finally get the actual response object.
    2) Another problem , witch I’m sure it can be soled , it’s that the Las Api returns a different type of response
      when there is an exception  ( when there is no service, etc).
